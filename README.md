# Project Rubic Discussions

---

## 1. Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.

* P Component:

P component is the most noticeable effect on the controller since it is directly propotional to CTE. As the CTE getting bigger, P component would drive the steering angle larger to keep vehicle on track. However, P conponent always overshoots as it only tracks CTE value and when CTE=0, the vehicle still has speed.

* D Component:

D component is introduced to solve overshooting problem with P component only. Instead of measuring CTE ifself, the D component takes differential of current and previous CTE values. When the vehicle is running close to track center, P component becomes less effective and the small difference between CTEs keeps the steering angle small and make vehicle on track.

* I Component:

I component has least effect on the controller as the parameter usually is small. It was mainly used to solve the systematically bias. For example, steering wheel bias. Since the mechaninal parts have limitation and may introduce certain offeset, the I component tracks sum of the CTEs over time and gradually correct the error that are hidden from P/D components.

## 2. Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.

The hyperparameters were manually tuned. I started with initial values from Sebastian's twiddle course, but soon found that those are too large and the vehicle went off-track quickly. Then I reduced all parameters by several orders and fine tuned each of them.

First, I largely reduced P parameter and keep D parameter relatively big as the track is narrow and I wanted to keep the vehicle on the center. Then, I also largely reduced I parameter since there is no obvious system bias observed.

Besides steering controller, I also made another PID controller to control throttle. Instead of using CTE as error argument, I used speed difference as the measure. The desired speed was set at 25 MPH and the parameters were tuned.

I keep P parameter relatively large as I wanted the vehicle to run close to desired speed but no need for it to stay there. I completely eliminated I component since it is a sum and will only increase.

The final paramers were chosen mainly by try and error and I was able to drive the vehicle properly and safely with the parameters: 

* Steering Controller: `Kp = 0.15, Ki = 0.0002, Kd = 3.0`.

* Throttle Controller: `Kp = 0.03, Ki = 0.0, Kd = 0.002`.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
